## Set up installer

### Get Composer

Go here and download composer and make sure this is set up for PHP use. If using phpenv, Composer is downloaded and installed for us. In case of any issues, go [here](https://getcomposer.org/).

### Laravel installer

The docs [here](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation) are very helpful. When installing the Laravel installer and CLI, don't forget to add the path to this that is in the ./composer dir to the /etc/paths or to the .zshrc or .bashrc so that we don't have to use the full path.
